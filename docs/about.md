## About This Project

This site documents my journey learning system design concepts, with a focus on preparing for FAANG-level technical interviews and building production-ready systems.

## Learning Approach

I'm following a structured daily plan that covers:

1. **Fundamental Concepts**: Building a solid foundation in distributed systems
2. **Practical Application**: Applying concepts to real-world scenarios
3. **Case Studies**: Analyzing existing large-scale systems
4. **Practice**: Regular design exercises and mock interviews

## Goals

- Master core system design principles
- Understand trade-offs in architectural decisions
- Build confidence in FAANG-level system design interviews
- Create a comprehensive reference guide for future use

## Site Structure

This site is built using:

- **MkDocs** with Material theme
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Markdown** for content
- **Mermaid** for diagrams
