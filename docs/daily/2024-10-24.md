## System Design Concepts

### Documentation as Learning Tool
Creating a public learning journal serves multiple purposes:
- Forces clear articulation of concepts
- Creates a personal reference guide
- Demonstrates learning progression to potential employers

## Questions to Explore
- [x] What are the fundamental building blocks of distributed systems? → [See Guide](../topics/building-blocks.md)
- [x] How do tech companies approach system design interviews? → [See Guide](../topics/interview-approach.md)
- [x] What are the most common scalability patterns? → [See Guide](../topics/scalability-patterns.md)

## Resources

## Practice Problems
*To be added as I progress through the curriculum*

## Reflections
Today was about setting up the foundation for my learning journey. The site structure is ready, and I'm excited to start filling it with knowledge. The key is consistency - committing to daily learning and documentation.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Start with fundamental system design concepts
- [ ] Review the FAANG system design plan in detail
- [ ] Complete first system design case study
